I am a first year PhD student in the [School or Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Dr. Shane Henderson](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shane/) and [Dr. David Shmoys](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/index.html). Prior to joining Cornell, I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science with a concentration in Mathematics, Statsitics, and Finance from the University of Toronto.

My work is supported by an NSERC PGS-D fellowship, received in 2019.
